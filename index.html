                <p class="content">
                    I'm an A-level student most passionate about how we can secure a positive long-term future for humanity. Most critical is ensuring that the emergence of potentially smarter-than-human AI systems occurs safely, minimising the risk of global catastrophe. Currently, I help others realise their potential for high impact, and their agency, through my work in <a href="https://www.leaf.courses/">Leaf's fellowship programmes</a>, which aims to increase the amount of talented, thoughtful, and creative people working in various key cause areas.<br><br>

                    In the past, I've also navigated these pressing areas through taking part in the <a href="https://www.non-trivial.org/">Non-Trivial Fellowship</a>, where I won a £500 scholarship for a project surrounding field-building within the field of AI safety. I've also done some interesting things over the years, such as conducting a psychological experiment on my school to assess the impact of instrumentation of musical tastes (more on that below), participating in the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/enrichment/summer-schools">UKMT NMSS '2024</a> and <a href="https://espr.camp/">ESPR '2025</a>, and running three half-marathons.<br><br> 

                    When I'm free nowadays, I'm usually training for my next race, resistance training, watching House M.D., preparing for the worst and hoping for the best, writing a <a href="https://muhammedtariq.substack.com/">blog post</a>, or creating some sea-lantern-infested Minecraft skyscrapers!

                        In February 2024, I was invited as a Finalist to Leaf's "Dilemmas and Dangers in AI" (DDAI) course, where I covered the most pressing risks brought on by the accelerating development of AI systems, such as inner/outer misalignment and convergent instrumental goals. From there, I went on to take part in their alumni fellowship, "The Mathematics of Morality", and then began to facilitate DDAI in the summer of 2024, where participants I led stated that I "did an exceptionally great job in introducing controversial counter-arguments for us to consider and discuss". 80% of them felt that I exceeded their expectations.<br><br>

                        During the 2025 cohort, I played a hand in helping improve Leaf's course content, facilitating weekly discussions, and being an influential part in the making of exceptional, altruistic teenagers. Above 80% of participants felt that I exceeded their expectations (with 100% feeling that I at least met them), and most described that I was "much better than they expected" or that I "blew their expectations out of the water".

                        This consisted of an 8-week fellowship on solving the world's most pressing problems, over which I created a project focusing on distilling information on the technical AI alignment landscape, and the potentially existential risks from AI as a whole, to a wider audience.<br><br>
                        
                        During the fellowship, I attended talks from pioneers such as philosopher Peter Singer and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, and I had guidance on my project from experts at top universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge and Stanford. Following the completion of the project, I was given a £500 scholarship to continue doing meaningful and important work.

                    <p class="description">
                        This group research project consisted of an initial psychological experiment conducted on our own school, which aimed to assess the extent to which instrumentation affected musical preferences using various statistical and sampling methods, such as the two-tailed t-test.<br><br>
                        
                        After it was (surprisingly!) determined that there was insufficient evidence supporting that instrumentation meaningfully effected musical preferences, we used it to inform the production of a simple computer program which used genre as a proxy to predict musical preferences, using dynamics and harmony. The program took a large, assorted set of songs of various genres, and another smaller list of songs of a genre we wanted to pick out. From there, the program would output the list of assorted songs in order of how closely they match the songs we want to pick out.<br><br>

                        Out of a list of 16 random songs (5 of which we wanted to pick out), the program successfully ranked 4 of the songs we wanted to pick out within the top 5 rankings.

                    <p class="description">
                        Being placed on the <a href="https://tomrocksmaths.com/2025/09/10/trm-essay-competition-2025-winners-shortlist-part-i-groups-1-8/">winner's shortlist</a>, my submission for this essay competition was on "back-of-the-envelope", or in this case, "napkin", calculations; i.e. Fermi problems. This (mainly fun) read begins with an estimation as to how many tennis balls fit within the Eiffel Tower, using techniques such as exponential interpolation to estimate the mathematical equation to which the tower's curve matches and knowledge of sphere packing, before then estimating how long it would take to find an atom hidden randomly in the universe, and then using the binomial formula to model the infinite monkey theorem given that, just like us, they are also allowed to make mistakes.<br><br>

                        After a brief dive into some smaller estimation problems, the essay ends with a poignant calculation on how much the average relationship (and breakup) weighs, and then ways in which Fermi estimations are really used in real life.
